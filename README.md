## Project Status

This project is still under development, and it's at a very early stage. The documentation it's also under development and it will be updated accordingly.

This is one of the Microservices that will compose the **Munnchy App** . *(Will reveal more details soon...)*

### Documentation 

You can take a look at the documentation [here](https://fireheet-store.readme.io/docs/getting-started).

There you will be able to test the [REST API](https://fireheet-store.readme.io/reference) and also take a look at the Architecture and Design of the application.

### Environment Setup

To start developing the project you must have the base environment setup.

If you don't have it, follow this [Getting Started](https://coda.io/d/_d7YJYrNEdKB/Installing-dependencies_suGEs)  guide, it will help on setting up everything.

After installing everything, just run:
```
yarn test:cov
```

And make sure the tests are running fine, and then you are good to go! üöÄ
