# üè¨Store Service *(WIP)* [![SemVer](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/fireheet/store-service?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/fireheet/store-service/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/fireheet/store-service)](https://github.com/fireheet/store-service/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Project presentation

This project is still under development, and it's prone to **breaking changes**.

This service will serve as one the services that will compose the **Munnchy App** . *(I will reveal more details about the project soon)*

The purpose of this project is to test my knowledge of programming skills into building a microservices based application and also will serve as a learning material as i will try do document the whole application, so that if someone wants to use it they will be able to do it, and also modify to their own will, but most important also to be able to build it from the ground up in any programming language.

### Documentation (WIP)

You can take a look at the documentation [here](https://fireheet-store.readme.io/docs/getting-started).

There you will be able to test the [REST API](https://fireheet-store.readme.io/reference) and also take a look at the Architecture and Design of the application.

### Environment Setup

To start developing the project you must have the base environment setup.

If you don't have it, follow this [Getting Started](https://coda.io/d/_d7YJYrNEdKB/Installing-dependencies_suGEs)  guide, it will help on setting up everything.

After installing everything, just run:
```
yarn test:cov
```

And make sure the tests are running fine, and then you are good to go! üöÄ
